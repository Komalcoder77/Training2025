# Day 1 ‚Äì Environment Setup

**Date:** 25th June 2025  
**Objective:** Setting up the environment for Linux and Virtualization-based training.

### ‚úÖ Tasks Completed:
1. Installed **Oracle VirtualBox** ‚Äì a free and open-source hosted hypervisor for x86 virtualization.
2. Installed **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** ‚Äì required for running certain Windows applications.
3. Downloaded and installed **Ubuntu (ISO)** ‚Äì to use as the guest OS in VirtualBox.

## üîÅ Booting and Its Types
**Booting** is the process of starting or restarting a computer system.  
There are two main types:

1. **Cold Booting** ‚Äì When the system is powered on from an off state.
2. **Warm Booting** ‚Äì When the system restarts without being turned off (e.g., using `Ctrl + Alt + Del`).

# Day 2 - Linux Basics: Kernel, Shell, Root, and Command

## Kernel
The **Kernel** is the core of an operating system.  
It manages system resources, memory, processes, and hardware communication.

## Shell and Its Categories
The **Shell** is an interface between the user and the kernel.
---
### Types of Shells:
bash (most Common, Friendlist)
sh (Original Shell, basic)
zsh (fancy waiter, more features)
fish ( user-friendliness, interactive features)
---

## Root User
**Root** is the superuser in Linux systems.  
The root has full administrative privileges and access to all files and commands.

## Day 3 ‚Äì Linux File Permissions, Redirection & Pipes

### Topics Covered:

1. **File Permissions using `chmod`**
   - Modified file permissions to control access:
     - `chmod 444 file` ‚Üí read-only for all users
     - `chmod 644 file` ‚Üí read/write for owner, read-only for others
     - `chmod +x script.sh` ‚Üí make a shell script executable

2. **Shell Script Creation (`.sh` files)**
   - Created basic shell scripts using `nano`
   - Saved with `.sh` extension
   - Made executable using `chmod +x`
   - Ran scripts using: `./filename.sh`

3. **Input/Output Redirection**
   - Used redirection operators:
     - `>` ‚Üí overwrite file
     - `>>` ‚Üí append to file
     - `<` ‚Üí read input from file
   - Example:

## üîê File Compression

File compression in Linux is the process of reducing the size of files or folders to save disk space or make them easier to transfer.

### üìå Syntax

```bash
gzip file.txt
# creates file.txt.gz and deletes file.txt

gunzip file.txt.gz
# unzips the file file.txt.gz

gzip -k file.txt
# keeps both file.txt and file.txt.gz
```

## üÉè Wildcards

Wildcards match files without typing their full names.

| Wildcard | Description                                 | Example             | Matches                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters              | `ls *.txt`          | All `.txt` files                       |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character                | `ls file?.txt`      | file1.txt, fileA.txt, etc.             |
| `[1-3]`  | Matches any one character in the brackets    | `ls file[1-3].txt`  | file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt        |
| `[^1]`   | Matches any one character NOT in the brackets| `ls file[^1].txt`   | All files except file1.txt             |
| `{a,b}`  | Matches either a or b (brace expansion)      | `echo {Jan,Feb}`    | Prints: `Jan Feb`                      |
| `\`      | Escapes a wildcard character                 | `ls \*.txt`         | Matches a file literally named `*.txt` |

---

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Escaping Characters

Escaping characters are used in the Linux command line (like Bash) to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.

> Escaping characters = telling the shell:  
> ‚ÄúTreat this symbol as a normal character, not something special.‚Äù

| Character | Purpose                                      | Example                      | Result                       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `\`       | Escape special characters                    | `echo \*`                    | `*`                          |
| `\"`      | Escape double quote inside double quotes     | `echo "She said \"Hi\""`     | She said "Hi"                |
| `\'`      | Escape single quote (rare in single quotes)  | `echo 'It\'s OK'`            | May not work properly        |
| `\\`      | Escape backslash                             | `echo \\`                    | `\`                          |
| ``\` ``   | Escape backtick / command substitution       | `` `echo Hello` ``           | Hello                        |
| `\$`      | Escape dollar sign (prevent expansion)       | `echo \$HOME`                | `$HOME`                      |
| `\` inside `''` | No effect (literal backslash)         | `echo '\$HOME'`              | `\$HOME`                     |
