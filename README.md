# Day 2 - Linux Basics: Booting, Kernel, Shell, Root, and Command

## 🔁 Booting and Its Types
**Booting** is the process of starting or restarting a computer system.  
There are two main types:

1. **Cold Booting** – When the system is powered on from an off state.
2. **Warm Booting** – When the system restarts without being turned off (e.g., using `Ctrl + Alt + Del`).

## 🧠 Kernel
The **Kernel** is the core of an operating system.  
It manages system resources, memory, processes, and hardware communication.
