## üîê File Compression

File compression in Linux is the process of reducing the size of files or folders to save disk space or make them easier to transfer.

### üìå Syntax

```bash
gzip file.txt
# creates file.txt.gz and deletes file.txt

gunzip file.txt.gz
# unzips the file file.txt.gz

gzip -k file.txt
# keeps both file.txt and file.txt.gz
```

## üÉè Wildcards

Wildcards match files without typing their full names.

| Wildcard | Description                                 | Example             | Matches                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters              | `ls *.txt`          | All `.txt` files                       |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character                | `ls file?.txt`      | file1.txt, fileA.txt, etc.             |
| `[1-3]`  | Matches any one character in the brackets    | `ls file[1-3].txt`  | file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt        |
| `[^1]`   | Matches any one character NOT in the brackets| `ls file[^1].txt`   | All files except file1.txt             |
| `{a,b}`  | Matches either a or b (brace expansion)      | `echo {Jan,Feb}`    | Prints: `Jan Feb`                      |
| `\`      | Escapes a wildcard character                 | `ls \*.txt`         | Matches a file literally named `*.txt` |

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Escaping Characters

Escaping characters are used in the Linux command line (like Bash) to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.

> Escaping characters = telling the shell:  
> ‚ÄúTreat this symbol as a normal character, not something special.‚Äù

| Character | Purpose                                      | Example                      | Result                       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `\`       | Escape special characters                    | `echo \*`                    | `*`                          |
| `\"`      | Escape double quote inside double quotes     | `echo "She said \"Hi\""`     | She said "Hi"                |
| `\'`      | Escape single quote (rare in single quotes)  | `echo 'It\'s OK'`            | May not work properly        |
| `\\`      | Escape backslash                             | `echo \\`                    | `\`                          |
| ``\` ``   | Escape backtick / command substitution       | `` `echo Hello` ``           | Hello                        |
| `\$`      | Escape dollar sign (prevent expansion)       | `echo \$HOME`                | `$HOME`                      |
| `\` inside `''` | No effect (literal backslash)         | `echo '\$HOME'`              | `\$HOME`                     |

# üõ†Ô∏è Training Day: 08

## üß† What is DHCP?
**DHCP ‚Äì Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**

### üìå Definition:
DHCP is a network protocol that automatically gives IP addresses to devices (like your phone, computer, etc.) when they connect to a network.

### üîß Why is DHCP used?
- To avoid manual IP configuration.
- To save time and reduce mistakes.
- Makes it easy to manage IPs in big networks.

### üß† How it Works (Simple Steps):
1. You connect your device to Wi-Fi.
2. Your device asks for an IP address.
3. The DHCP server picks a free IP and gives it to your device.
4. You are now connected to the network and internet!

### üìé Example:
You connect your laptop to Wi-Fi.  
DHCP gives it IP: `192.168.1.5`  
Next time, it may give a different IP like `192.168.1.8`.

### üßæ Key Terms:

| Term         | Meaning                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| DHCP Server  | The device (router or server) that gives IP addresses |
| DHCP Client  | The device (your phone, PC, etc.) that gets an IP    |

### üîÑ Without DHCP vs With DHCP

| Action         | Manual IP (No DHCP) | DHCP (Automatic)     |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Set IP Address | You do it manually  | Given automatically   |
| Easy to Use?   | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Error chances  | High                | Low                   |

**‚úÖ In Simple Words:** DHCP is like an auto-assign system that gives an IP address to each device, so you don‚Äôt have to do it yourself.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Networking Commands: `ping`, `traceroute`, `ifconfig`

# ‚úÖ 1. `ping` Command

**üìå What is it?**  
`ping` checks if another computer or website is reachable and shows how long the data takes to travel there and back.

**üß† Technical Meaning:**  
It sends small data packets (ICMP echo requests) to a target IP or domain, and waits for a reply.

**üß™ Example Command:**
```bash
ping google.com

# CSS Styling: Inline, Internal & External
### What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language that lets you control the visual appearance of HTML content ‚Äî things like layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

You can add CSS to your web page in three main ways:

### 1. Inline CSS
This method places the CSS directly inside an HTML tag using the style attribute.

It's best used for quick changes or testing small tweaks.

**Example:**

<p style="color: green; font-size: 18px;">This text is styled using inline CSS.</p>
### 2. Internal CSS
In this approach, the CSS code is written inside a <style> tag, which is placed within the <head> section of your HTML file.

It's useful when you're working on just one page and want all styles to stay within that same file.

**Example:**

<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #f0fff0;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
    h1 {
      color: darkgreen;
    }
  </style>
</head>

### 3. External CSS
This method keeps your CSS in a separate file (with a .css extension) and links it to your HTML page using the <link> tag.

It's the most organized and reusable method, especially when you're working on a multi-page website.

HTML File:

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
styles.css File:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
  background-color: #e6ffe6;
  font-family: Verdana;
}
h1 {
  color: seagreen;
  text-align: center;
}

# What is Git and Why Use Version Control?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.It helps manage code across multiple versions, developers, and updates.

### Why Use Version Control?
1. Tracks Your Work
2. Collaboration Made Easy
3. Backup and Safety
4.  Branching and Experimenting
5.  Open Source and Free

### Git Architecture:
 ### 1. Repository (Repo)
A storage location where Git tracks all changes made to your files over time.

Can be:

Local ‚Äì stored on your own computer

Remote ‚Äì hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

### 2. Working Tree (or Working Directory)
The actual files and folders you're working with on your system right now.

It reflects the current version of your project

You make your changes here before saving them permanently with Git

### 3. Index (Staging Area)
A middle layer where you place files before committing them to the repository.

You use git add to move changes here

It gives you control over what goes into the next commit

Think of it as a review area before saving

# How to Use Git (Using Command Line)
# Step 1: Create or Clone a Repository
First, get the repository link (usually ends with .git) from GitHub

Open Git Bash (or terminal)

Run this command to clone the repository:

Move into the project folder:
<img width="633" height="612" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9571563-31ad-4d93-a3bd-dafbbbd9350d" />
<img width="735" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3d3479d-d39e-4963-836b-482f314d47bc" />

(Optional) Check the files using ls

# Step 2: Check Git Status
Use this to see changes or file status:

If it says "Up to date", everything is in sync

# Step 3: Create and Edit a New File
Create a new HTML file:

Open and write your code in it:


Save the file after editing (in Nano, press Ctrl + O, then Enter, then Ctrl + X to exit)

# Step 4: Add the File to Staging Area
Stage the file for commit:

**Warning:**
If you see a message like:
**warning:** in the working copy of 'index.html', LF will be replaced by CRLF
‚Üí It means Git will convert line endings to match Windows (CRLF). It's safe to ignore.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Save your changes to the local repo with a message:

Set your name and email using:


Try committing again:

### Step 6: Push to Remote Repository
Send your changes to GitHub:

You may be asked to authorize Git Credential Manager

Click "Authorize git-ecosystem"

Enter your GitHub username and password or token

## üìÇ Branching and Merging in Git

### üîπ What is Branching?

**Branching** means creating a separate line of development. It allows you to work on features or fixes independently without affecting the main code.

### ‚úÖ Features of Branching

- Isolates development work (feature, bug fix, etc.)
- Enables simultaneous collaboration
- Prevents code conflicts
- Allows merging into main branch
- Lightweight and fast

---

### üß† Simple Analogy

> Think of Git as a tree:  
> - The `main` branch is the trunk.  
> - New branches are limbs growing off the trunk.  
> - You do work on the limb and later merge it back into the trunk.

---

### ü¶™ Steps to Perform Branching in Git

**üíº Example Folder:** `Practice`

#### 1. Create a New Branch

```bash
git branch my-feature
```

#### 2. Switch to the New Branch (Checkout)

```bash
git checkout my-feature
```

üëâ *Create and switch in one step:*

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

#### 3. Make Changes ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature X"
```

#### 4. Switch Back to Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

#### 5. Merge Feature Branch into Main

```bash
git merge my-feature
```

üìÖ Now your feature is merged into the main branch.

---

## ü¶Å Merging in Git

- Combines changes from one branch into another.
- May result in **merge conflicts**, which must be resolved manually.
- Helps integrate completed work into the main project.

**Merge command:**

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

---

## üåê Remote Operations in Git

### üîπ `git push`

Sends your **local commits** to the **remote** repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### üîπ `git pull`

Fetches changes from the **remote** and merges them into your local branch.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

### üîπ `git remote`

Manages remote repository connections.

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## üêô GitHub / GitLab Basics

### ‚úîÔ∏è What are GitHub and GitLab?

They are **online platforms** that host Git repositories and provide features like:

- Pull/Merge Requests  
- Issue Tracking  
- Collaboration Tools  
- CI/CD Integration  

---

### üîß Common Uses

- Store and manage code online  
- Collaborate on private/public projects  
- Review code using Pull Requests (PRs)  

---
