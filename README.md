## üîê File Compression

File compression in Linux is the process of reducing the size of files or folders to save disk space or make them easier to transfer.

### üìå Syntax

```bash
gzip file.txt
# creates file.txt.gz and deletes file.txt

gunzip file.txt.gz
# unzips the file file.txt.gz

gzip -k file.txt
# keeps both file.txt and file.txt.gz
```

## üÉè Wildcards

Wildcards match files without typing their full names.

| Wildcard | Description                                 | Example             | Matches                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters              | `ls *.txt`          | All `.txt` files                       |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character                | `ls file?.txt`      | file1.txt, fileA.txt, etc.             |
| `[1-3]`  | Matches any one character in the brackets    | `ls file[1-3].txt`  | file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt        |
| `[^1]`   | Matches any one character NOT in the brackets| `ls file[^1].txt`   | All files except file1.txt             |
| `{a,b}`  | Matches either a or b (brace expansion)      | `echo {Jan,Feb}`    | Prints: `Jan Feb`                      |
| `\`      | Escapes a wildcard character                 | `ls \*.txt`         | Matches a file literally named `*.txt` |

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Escaping Characters

Escaping characters are used in the Linux command line (like Bash) to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.

> Escaping characters = telling the shell:  
> ‚ÄúTreat this symbol as a normal character, not something special.‚Äù

| Character | Purpose                                      | Example                      | Result                       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `\`       | Escape special characters                    | `echo \*`                    | `*`                          |
| `\"`      | Escape double quote inside double quotes     | `echo "She said \"Hi\""`     | She said "Hi"                |
| `\'`      | Escape single quote (rare in single quotes)  | `echo 'It\'s OK'`            | May not work properly        |
| `\\`      | Escape backslash                             | `echo \\`                    | `\`                          |
| ``\` ``   | Escape backtick / command substitution       | `` `echo Hello` ``           | Hello                        |
| `\$`      | Escape dollar sign (prevent expansion)       | `echo \$HOME`                | `$HOME`                      |
| `\` inside `''` | No effect (literal backslash)         | `echo '\$HOME'`              | `\$HOME`                     |

# Networking  Basics
### Hosts :
A host refers to any device that connects to a network and is capable of sending or receiving data. This includes:

* Computers (Desktops, Laptops)

* Servers

* Smartphones

* Printers

* IP cameras

* IoT devices (like smart TVs, smart bulbs, etc.)

![host](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1beb5235-156d-475e-ac26-dc22f161f254)

# Network :
A network is a group of two or more connected devices (like computers, servers, or mobile phones) that are linked together to share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other. These devices are connected using wired (like Ethernet cables) or wireless (like Wi-Fi) communication methods.

**Key Features:**
Data sharing (files, messages)

Resource sharing (printers, internet)

Communication (email, video calls)

Centralized or distributed control

# IP Address:
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to each device connected to a network. It helps in identifying and locating devices so they can communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

### Types of IP Addresses
**1. Public IP Address :** Assigned to your network by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), allowing devices within your network to communicate with the internet.

**2.Private IP Address :** Used within a private network (e.g., home or office) and not routable over the internet. Devices within the same local network communicate using private IPs.

### Properties of an IP Address:
**1. Unique**
* Every IP address must be unique within a network.

* This means no two devices on the same network can have the same IP address.

* If two devices have the same IP, it leads to IP address conflicts, and communication may fail.

* Example: If your laptop has the IP 192.168.1.10, no other device in that network can use the same address at the same time.

**2. Universal**
* IP addresses follow a universal standard that is understood worldwide.

* No matter where you are, IP addresses follow the same format (IPv4 or IPv6).

* This allows devices from different parts of the world to communicate with each other over the internet.

* It ensures global connectivity and compatibility between networks and devices.

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4):
**Address Length:**

* IPv4 uses a 32-bit address format.

* This means the IP address is made up of 32 binary digits (0s and 1s).

**Notation:**

* IPv4 addresses are written in decimal format.

* The 32 bits are divided into 4 groups, called octets.

* Each octet is separated by a dot (.).

* Each octet can range from 0 to 255.

* Example: 192.168.1.1.

**Address Space:**

* Since IPv4 uses 32 bits, it can have 2¬≥¬≤ = 4,294,967,296 unique addresses.

* This gives approximately 4.3 billion possible IP addresses.

* Due to the large number of internet-connected devices, this space is becoming exhausted.

### IPv6 Explanation in Points
**Address Length:**

* IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format.

* This means each IP address is made up of 128 binary digits (0s and 1s).

* It provides a much larger range than IPv4.

**Notation:**

* IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal format.

* The 128 bits are divided into 8 groups, each containing 4 hexadecimal digits.

* Groups are separated by colons (:).

* Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

**Address Space:**

* IPv6 provides 2¬π¬≤‚Å∏ = 340 undecillion unique addresses.

* This is enough to assign trillions of addresses to every person or device on Earth.

* The huge space ensures scalability for the future internet.

### IPv4 vs IPv6:

|Feature|	IPv4|	IPv6|
|-------|-----|-----|
|Address Length|	32 bits (4 octets)|	128 bits (16 octets)|
|Address Format|	Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1)|	Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)|
|Address Space|	~4.3 billion addresses|	~340 undecillion addresses|
|Configuration|	Manual or DHCP|	Auto-configuration (SLAAC) or DHCPv6|

![IP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/693b218c-c492-4a09-9aef-d6f8d4343d47)

# Notation:
### Binary Notation (used internally in networking)
* In binary notation, an IP address is written in binary (base-2) numbers ‚Äî using only 0s and 1s.

* IPv4 addresses are made up of 32 bits, which are grouped into 4 sets of 8 bits (called octets).

* Computers use this format to understand and process IP addresses.

* Example:
Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
This represents the IP address in binary form.

### 2. Dotted Decimal Notation (used by humans)
* In dotted decimal notation, the 32-bit binary address is converted into 4 decimal numbers.

* Each 8-bit binary group (octet) is converted to a number between 0 and 255.

* The four decimal numbers are separated by dots (.).

* This is the standard readable format for IPv4 addresses.

* Example:
Binary:      11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001  
Decimal:     192      .168      .1        .1  
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.1

# Classful Addressing in IP (IPv4)
Classful addressing is a system used in IPv4 to divide the IP address space into five classes (A to E) based on the first few bits of the IP address. Each class has a different range, size of network and host portions, and specific use.

This method helps in identifying how much of the IP address is used for the network part and how much is used for the host part.

### Structure of IPv4 Address:
* IPv4 address = 32 bits

* Divided into network part and host part (depending on the class)

**IP Address Classes:**  
|Class|	Starting Bits|	Range of First Octet|	Network/Host Bits	|No. of Hosts	Use|
|-----|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
|A|	0xxxxxxx|	1 ‚Äì 126|	8 bits (N) / 24 bits (H)|	~16 million per network	Large networks|
|B|	10xxxxxx|	128 ‚Äì 191|	16 bits (N) / 16 bits (H)|	~65,000 per network	Medium-sized networks|
|C|	110xxxxx|	192 ‚Äì 223|	24 bits (N) / 8 bits (H)|	254 hosts per network	Small networks|
|D|	1110xxxx|	224 ‚Äì 239|	Not divided (multicast)|	Not for host addressing	Multicast communication|
|E|	1111xxxx|	240 ‚Äì 255|	Reserved	Not used for devices|	Research & Experimental use|

 **Key Points of Classful Addressing:**
* Divides IP addresses into fixed classes (A‚ÄìE).

* Helps in identifying the size of the network.

* Simple but wastes IP addresses (not efficient).

* Replaced by Classless Addressing (CIDR) for better IP utilization.

|Mapping|	One-to-one type of communication.|	One-to-many type of communication.|	Many-to-many type of communication.|
|Uses|	Used for direct communication like web browsing, emails, etc.|	Used in TV/radio networks, ARP, DHCP discovery, etc.|	Used in stock exchanges, live video streaming, multimedia delivery.|

# Subnetting:
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, manageable sub-networks called subnets. It helps in efficient use of IP addresses, reduces network traffic, and improves security by isolating different parts of a network.
or 
Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks. It helps to utilize the network bandwidth in more intelligent way.

* Bandwidth: Capacity of network; data transmission rate (e.g., Mbps). Should be maximum.

* Latency: Delay in data transmission. Should be minimum.

* Host Bits: Denoted by '0's in subnet mask.

* Network IP: First IP of a subnet (cannot be assigned to host).

* Broadcast IP: Last IP of a subnet (cannot be assigned to host).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dae5fc9-981f-4c78-b36a-b41a616dffcb)

### Subnet Mask :
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used to separate the network part and the host part of an IP address. It helps identify which portion of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host within that network.

* Example:
For IP 192.168.1.10 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0,

255.255.255.0 means the first 3 octets are the network part,

The last octet is for hosts.
### MAC (Media Access Control Address):

**Nature:** A unique, 12-character hexadecimal (alphanumeric) attribute used to identify individual electronic devices on a network.
Distinction from IP Address:
**MAC Address:** Identifies the physical location of a device within a local network. It's like your permanent home address. The manufacturer provides it.
**IP Address:** Signifies the device's global or internet-accessible identity. It's more like a temporary vacation rental address, changing depending on your network connection.

### DNS (Domain Name System):
It is a naming system for computers, service etc connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates domain names (www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (172.217.160.142).

**Default Gateway:**
Its a device (typically a router) that acts as a pathway for data to leave a local network and reach other networks, including the internet.

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
Modern method for IP allocation and routing, replacing classful addressing with more flexible network sizing (e.g., /24).
**Types of Cables**
**Twisted Pair:**
Types: Shielded (STP) and Unshielded (UTP).
Use: LANs (Ethernet).
**Coaxial:**
Use: TV networks, older computer networks.
**Fiber-Optic:**
Use: High-speed networks, long distances (most commonly used today).

# Numerical:

For 205.150.65.0/26. Find:
Subset mask
Number of subsets
Number of hosts
Network IP
Broadcast IP.

**Solution:**
1. Subnet Mask
/26 means 26 bits are used for the network portion.

So, the subnet mask in decimal is:

Copy
Edit
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 ‚Üí 255.255.255.192
Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.192

2. Number of Subnets
Given: It's from Class C (default /24), and we're using /26

Subnet bits = 26 - 24 = 2 bits

Number of subnets = 2¬≤ = 4

Number of Subnets = 4

3. Number of Hosts per Subnet
Host bits = 32 - 26 = 6 bits

Number of hosts = 2‚Å∂ - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62
(Subtract 2 for Network & Broadcast addresses)

Number of Hosts = 62 per subnet

4. Network IP (of first subnet)
Subnet range = 2‚Å∂ = 64 IPs per subnet

First subnet starts at:

Network IP = 205.150.65.0

5. Broadcast IP (of first subnet)
Broadcast = Last IP of the subnet

First subnet = 205.150.65.0 ‚Äì 205.150.65.63

Broadcast IP = 205.150.65.63
