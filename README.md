## Day 3 – Linux File Permissions, Redirection & Pipes

### Topics Covered:

1. **File Permissions using `chmod`**
   - Modified file permissions to control access:
     - `chmod 444 file` → read-only for all users
     - `chmod 644 file` → read/write for owner, read-only for others
     - `chmod +x script.sh` → make a shell script executable

2. **Shell Script Creation (`.sh` files)**
   - Created basic shell scripts using `nano`
   - Saved with `.sh` extension
   - Made executable using `chmod +x`
   - Ran scripts using: `./filename.sh`

3. **Input/Output Redirection**
   - Used redirection operators:
     - `>` → overwrite file
     - `>>` → append to file
     - `<` → read input from file
   - Example:

## 🔐 File Compression

File compression in Linux is the process of reducing the size of files or folders to save disk space or make them easier to transfer.

### 📌 Syntax

```bash
gzip file.txt
# creates file.txt.gz and deletes file.txt

gunzip file.txt.gz
# unzips the file file.txt.gz

gzip -k file.txt
# keeps both file.txt and file.txt.gz
```

## 🃏 Wildcards

Wildcards match files without typing their full names.

| Wildcard | Description                                 | Example             | Matches                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters              | `ls *.txt`          | All `.txt` files                       |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character                | `ls file?.txt`      | file1.txt, fileA.txt, etc.             |
| `[1-3]`  | Matches any one character in the brackets    | `ls file[1-3].txt`  | file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt        |
| `[^1]`   | Matches any one character NOT in the brackets| `ls file[^1].txt`   | All files except file1.txt             |
| `{a,b}`  | Matches either a or b (brace expansion)      | `echo {Jan,Feb}`    | Prints: `Jan Feb`                      |
| `\`      | Escapes a wildcard character                 | `ls \*.txt`         | Matches a file literally named `*.txt` |

---

## ✳️ Escaping Characters

Escaping characters are used in the Linux command line (like Bash) to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.

> Escaping characters = telling the shell:  
> “Treat this symbol as a normal character, not something special.”

| Character | Purpose                                      | Example                      | Result                       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `\`       | Escape special characters                    | `echo \*`                    | `*`                          |
| `\"`      | Escape double quote inside double quotes     | `echo "She said \"Hi\""`     | She said "Hi"                |
| `\'`      | Escape single quote (rare in single quotes)  | `echo 'It\'s OK'`            | May not work properly        |
| `\\`      | Escape backslash                             | `echo \\`                    | `\`                          |
| ``\` ``   | Escape backtick / command substitution       | `` `echo Hello` ``           | Hello                        |
| `\$`      | Escape dollar sign (prevent expansion)       | `echo \$HOME`                | `$HOME`                      |
| `\` inside `''` | No effect (literal backslash)         | `echo '\$HOME'`              | `\$HOME`                     |

## 🔢 Subnetting Essentials

**Subnetting** breaks a large network into smaller, efficient sub-networks to reduce congestion and boost performance.

- **Bandwidth:** Data transfer rate (↑ better)
- **Latency:** Delay in communication (↓ better)
- **Network IP:** First address in a subnet
- **Broadcast IP:** Last address (reserved)

---

## 🧮 Subnet Mask

Used to distinguish between network and host portions of an IP.

**Example:**
IP: 192.168.1.10  
Mask: 255.255.255.0 → First 3 octets for network

---

## 🆔 MAC Address

A **MAC Address** is a permanent, physical ID assigned to a device by its manufacturer. It's used locally, unlike IP addresses which are logical and changeable.

---

## 🌍 DNS - Domain Name System

DNS converts human-readable web addresses like `www.google.com` into machine-readable IPs like `142.250.77.238`.

---

## 🛤 Default Gateway

The **default gateway** is your device’s door to the external network (usually your router).

---

## 🔢 CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing

CIDR allows flexible subnetting using notation like `/24`, replacing rigid classes.

---

## 📡 Types of Network Cables

- **Twisted Pair (UTP/STP):** Common in LANs
- **Coaxial:** Used in older networks, TV
- **Fiber Optic:** Fastest; used for long-distance data

---

## 🧠 Numerical Example:

**Given:** `205.150.65.0/26`

1. **Subnet Mask:**  
   26 bits → 255.255.255.192

2. **Subnets Possible:**  
   /26 from Class C (/24) → 2 bits → `2² = 4`

3. **Hosts per Subnet:**  
   32 - 26 = 6 bits → `2⁶ - 2 = 62`

4. **Network IP:**  
   First Subnet starts at → `205.150.65.0`

5. **Broadcast IP:**  
   First Subnet ends at → `205.150.65.63`

# 🛠️ Training Day: 08

## 🧠 What is DHCP?
**DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**

### 📌 Definition:
DHCP is a network protocol that automatically gives IP addresses to devices (like your phone, computer, etc.) when they connect to a network.

### 🔧 Why is DHCP used?
- To avoid manual IP configuration.
- To save time and reduce mistakes.
- Makes it easy to manage IPs in big networks.

### 🧠 How it Works (Simple Steps):
1. You connect your device to Wi-Fi.
2. Your device asks for an IP address.
3. The DHCP server picks a free IP and gives it to your device.
4. You are now connected to the network and internet!

### 📎 Example:
You connect your laptop to Wi-Fi.  
DHCP gives it IP: `192.168.1.5`  
Next time, it may give a different IP like `192.168.1.8`.

### 🧾 Key Terms:

| Term         | Meaning                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| DHCP Server  | The device (router or server) that gives IP addresses |
| DHCP Client  | The device (your phone, PC, etc.) that gets an IP    |

### 🔄 Without DHCP vs With DHCP

| Action         | Manual IP (No DHCP) | DHCP (Automatic)     |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Set IP Address | You do it manually  | Given automatically   |
| Easy to Use?   | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes               |
| Error chances  | High                | Low                   |

**✅ In Simple Words:** DHCP is like an auto-assign system that gives an IP address to each device, so you don’t have to do it yourself.

---

## 🛠️ Networking Commands: `ping`, `traceroute`, `ifconfig`

### ✅ 1. `ping` Command

**📌 What is it?**  
`ping` checks if another computer or website is reachable and shows how long the data takes to travel there and back.

**🧠 Technical Meaning:**  
It sends small data packets (ICMP echo requests) to a target IP or domain, and waits for a reply.

**🧪 Example Command:**
```bash
ping google.com
